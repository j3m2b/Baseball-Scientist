## TOP STORYLINES AFTER 1 MONTH

### 1. Dodgers Living Up to Hype (18-7)
**Shohei Ohtani:** .315 BA, 8 HR, 22 RBI as DH; 3-1, 2.10 ERA as pitcher - TWO-WAY DOMINANCE
**Roki Sasaki:** 4-0, 1.20 ERA, 38 K in 30 IP - BETTER THAN ADVERTISED
**Mookie Betts:** .335 BA, playing elite SS defense
**Freddie Freeman:** .290 BA, 6 HR - steady as always
**Key:** Rotation depth insane - Yamamoto, Glasnow, Kershaw all solid
**Projection:** On pace for 117 wins (!!)

### 2. Orioles Young Core Exploding (17-8)
**Gunnar Henderson:** .340 BA, 9 HR, 26 RBI - **EARLY MVP FAVORITE**
**Adley Rutschman:** .305 BA, elite defense continuing
**Grayson Rodriguez:** 4-1, 2.45 ERA - ace emergence
**Key:** Young players taking leap simultaneously
**Surprising:** Pitching depth holding up better than expected

### 3. White Sox Historical Disaster (5-20)
**Luis Robert Jr.:** .210 BA, clearly checked out
**Rotation:** 6.75 ERA (worst in MLB)
**Clubhouse:** Reports of players openly tanking
**Key:** On pace for 121 losses (would break modern record)
**Trade Rumors:** Dylan Cease, Luis Robert available

### 4. Juan Soto with Mets - Solid, Not Spectacular
**Stats:** .285 BA, 7 HR, 20 RBI - good but not $765M good (yet)
**Mets Record:** 14-11 (3rd in division)
**Key:** Pressing? Adjusting to NL East pitching?
**Narrative:** Media questioning if worth the money (too early!)

### 5. Elly De La Cruz Breakout (CIN)
**Stats:** .305 BA, 6 HR, **12 SB** - electric speed
**Defense:** Highlight-reel plays at SS daily
**Key:** Making Reds (15-10) surprise contender
**Projection:** 40-40 season possible

### 6. Injury Bug Strikes
**Mike Trout (LAA):** Hamstring, out 4-6 weeks - same story every year
**Jacob deGrom (TEX):** Elbow tightness, out 2-3 weeks - concerning
**Sandy Alcántara (MIA):** TJ surgery recovery slower than hoped
**Key:** Aging stars breaking down

### 7. Twins Hot Start - Buxton Healthy!
**Byron Buxton:** .320 BA, 8 HR - PLAYING like MVP
**Key:** If healthy, changes entire AL Central race
**Projection:** Can he stay healthy? (History says no)

### 8. Yankees Missing Soto (15-10)
**Aaron Judge:** .295 BA, 10 HR - carrying team alone
**Lineup Hole:** #2 spot weak without Soto
**Key:** Rotation strong (Cole, Rodón), but offense lacking
**Narrative:** Should they have matched Mets' offer?

## ADJUSTED PREDICTIONS AFTER 1 MONTH

### Updated Division Races

**AL East:** Orioles pulling away early, Yankees chasing
- Baltimore: 95-67 (was 95-67) - CONFIRMED
- New York: 90-72 (was 93-69) - missing Soto

**NL West:** Dodgers dominant, no one close
- LA Dodgers: 105-57 (was 101-61) - BETTER than expected!
- San Diego: 85-77 (was 87-75) - can't keep pace

**AL Central:** White Sox tanking, Twins surprise
- Minnesota: 88-74 (was 85-77) - Buxton healthy = boost
- Chicago WS: 60-102 (was 65-97) - WORSE than expected

### Regression Candidates (Hot Starts Unsustainable?)

- **Gunnar Henderson:** .340 BA - likely regresses to .290-.300 (still elite)
- **Roki Sasaki:** 1.20 ERA - will regress to ~2.80-3.20 (still great)

### Breakout Sustain Predictions
- **Elly De La Cruz:** REAL - could finish .285, 30 HR, 60 SB

### Injury Impact
- **Mike Trout out:** Angels now 70-92 (was 72-90)
